## Dublin Marathon Visualization Project (early prototype)

The idea behind this project was to explore how to visualize race results data from nothing other than the result information made available online by race organizers.

There are currently 2 prototypes available to view:

### Results by Gender

https://jimmyreno.github.io/index.html

Shows the distribution of results by time/gender. This chart also contains a sample filter that displays the results of my club-mates in Brothers Pearse A.C. 

Also of note in this chart are the peaks at certain finsh times - these represent large packs of runners following the pace-makers in order to hit their target times.

### Race Simulator

https://jimmyreno.github.io/map.html

The race simulator is a map-based replay of a single athlete's race. The replay estimates the athlete's position and elapsed time, and also presents an elevation graph for their location. These estimates are based on the set of split-times taken during the race.
